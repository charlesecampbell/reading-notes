Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
The browser parses the HTML file first, and tje leads to the browser reorganizing any <link>-element referneces toexternal CSS stylsheets and any <script>-element referneces to scripts.
As the brower parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has fround from <link> elemets, and from those, then parses the CSS amnd JavaScript.
The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from tje parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and  compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.
As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.
